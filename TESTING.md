Lighthouse

I used the Lighthouse reports in Google Developer Tools to examine the pages of the website for the following
- Performace
- Accessibility
- Best Practices 
- SEO

All Pages performed well in 
- all areas on Desktop
- in Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO on Mobile

Pages which featured a lot of images did not perform as well in 
- Performance on mobile

Lighthouse recommends saving images in next-gen formats and eliminating render-blocking resources to improve performance on mobile.
