Lighthouse

I used the Lighthouse reports in Google Developer Tools to examine the pages of the website for the following
- Performace
- Accessibility
- Best Practices 
- SEO

All Pages performed well (scored 97 and above) in:
- Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO on Desktop
- Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO on Mobile

Some Pages did not perform as well (scored 85 and above) in:
- Performance on mobile

Lighthouse recommends saving images in next-gen formats and eliminating render-blocking resources to improve performance on mobile.
