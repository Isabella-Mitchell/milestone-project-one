# Row Gallery Website 
## Milestone Project 1 

* The aim of this project is to build a static front-end website. The website is required to have at least 3 pages and be built using technologies I have learnt so far including HTML and CSS. The aim of the site is to provide value to both the user and the site owner through a clear presentation of data. 

* For this project, I have created a website for a fictitious art gallery called Row Gallery, located in Dungeness, UK. The focus of the design is to provide a good user experience and a structured layout of information. The website is responsive, so it is functional and looks good on any device screen size.
