# Row Gallery Website 
## Milestone Project 1 

* The aim of this project is to build a static front-end website. The website is required to have at least 3 pages and be built using technologies I have learnt so far including HTML and CSS. The aim of the site is to provide value to both the user and the site owner through a clear presentation of data. 

* For this project, I have created a website for a fictitious art gallery called Row Gallery, located in Dungeness, UK. The focus of the design is to provide a good user experience and a structured layout of information. The website is responsive, so it is functional and looks good on any device screen size. 

* My website consists of a homepage to introduce the gallery and the main sections of the website. The site then has 4 pages, one with information about exhibitions, one with information about the gallery's artists, one with information about the gallery and visiting information and a contact page with a contact form.

- ### Site Structure
    - The website has a Homepage, and then 4 further pages; Exhibitions, Artists, About and Contact.
    - Each page is featured the nav bar, allowing the user to easily navigate between them without needing to go back to the homepage.
    - On smaller device sizes, a 'Back To Top' button appears at the bottom of the screen
    - Page Links listed at the top of each page allow users to quickly jump to content.
    - Most pages feature buttons with 'call to actions' and internal links where appropriate, quickly directing them to relevant information on another page. E.g. you can access the About page for visiting information from the Exhbitions page.
    - The Footer remains consistant on each page.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

A simple and refined colour scheme has been used. The pale backgrounds of the website mimic the pale walls of the gallery space, so that the images take centre stage. 

I used the (Material Design Colour Tool)[https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0] to decide the footer colour. The footer colour is inkeeping with the palette yet distinguishes this section from the others on the page. 

### Typography

Headings are in Josefin Sans and normal text is in Lato. Josefin Sans is a striking font which adds character to the website. Lato is a clean and easily readable font frequently used for websites and applications. Sans serif is the fallback font in case the font can not be imported into the site correctly.

### Imagery

Imagery is very important feature of the website, as the website needs to appeal visually to users and represent the gallery in a good light. 

The pages feature different image layouts, due to the type of images that need to be displayed. I researched art gallery websites including Pace Gallery and Arusha Gallery to see the types of content that they typically display on their websites. I incorporated the following into my website:
- Image Slideshows in landscape orientation on the Exhibition Page
- Image captions on the Exhibitions Page
- Artist Portraits on the Artist page

Consistant image ratios have been used to bring a harmony to the site across different page layouts.
- include 16:9 and 3:4.

## Features

Note: Deciding to keep long scroll pages to reduce number of clicks (and hierarchacal navigation) Though conscious that mobile and tablet are long. To investigate back to top/ sticky nav.
